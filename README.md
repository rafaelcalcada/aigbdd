## AIGBDD - And-Inverter Graphs Logic Equivalence Checker

This project consists of two programs, `aiglec` and `aigviz`. The first can fast check the logic equivalence between 2 small AIGs (with up to 10 inputs) using Reduced Ordered Binary Decision Diagrams (BDDs). The second generates graphic visualization of an AIG and its associated BDD.
